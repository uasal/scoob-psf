Notes about the abbreviations used here: 
    ifp = intermediate focal plane
    fm = fold mirror
    km = K-mirror
    Roap = Relay OAP
    AOoap = AO bench OAP
    fpsm = focal plane steering mirror
    pfm = periscope fold mirror
    pupilSM = pupil steering mirror

These are the corrections (or fudge-factors) calculated using the Fresnel model
in order to fix the issue with focal-planes not being a tight focus or pupil planes
not being reimaged correctly.
